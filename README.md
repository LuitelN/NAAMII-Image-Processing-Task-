# Knee CT Images Segmentation and Landmark Detection

This repository contains Python code for segmenting femur and tibia bones from a coronal slice of a 3D CT image, generating masks and identifying landmarks in tibia. It exports results in NIfTI format and saves landmark coordinates data as a CSV. 

## Description

This image processing task consists of working on .nii.gz CT scan images in 3D after conversion to 2D and analysis through bone segmentation and masking concepts.
